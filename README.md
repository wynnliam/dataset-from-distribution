# Dataset from Distribution

For this project, you generate a dataset of values according to a specified
distribution.

Specifically, this program generates a textfile *test.output*. Each line
of this text file is a value between 1 and 20 (inclusive bounds). The values
are sampled according to the following table:

| Value | Count          |
|:-----:|:--------------:|
| 20    | 5              |
| 19    | 10             |
| 18    | 25             |
| 17    | 50             |
| 16    | 100            |
| 15    | 250            |
| 14    | 500            |
| 13    | 1000           |
| 12    | 83,000         |
| 11    | 83,000         |
| 10    | 83,000         |
|  9    | 83,000         |
|  8    | 83,000         |
|  7    | 83,000         |
|  6    | 83,000         |
|  5    | 83,000         |
|  4    | 83,000         |
|  3    | 83,000         |
|  2    | 83,000         |
|  1    | 83,000         |

Rules for the dataset:
1. All 997940 values must be in it (one line per value).
2. No two consecutive values in the dataset should be the same.

This program will also print out all lines that contain the value 20.
