# Dataset from Distribution

For this project, you generate a dataset of values according to a specified
distribution.

Specifically, this program generates a textfile *test.output*. Each line
of this text file is a value between 1 and 20 (inclusive bounds). The values
are sampled according to the following table:

| Value | Count          |
|:-----:|:--------------:|
| 20    | 5              |
| 19    | 10             |
| 18    | 25             |
| 17    | 50             |
| 16    | 100            |
| 15    | 250            |
| 14    | 500            |
| 13    | 1000           |
| 12    | 83,000         |
| 11    | 83,000         |
| 10    | 83,000         |
|  9    | 83,000         |
|  8    | 83,000         |
|  7    | 83,000         |
|  6    | 83,000         |
|  5    | 83,000         |
|  4    | 83,000         |
|  3    | 83,000         |
|  2    | 83,000         |
