# Dataset from Distribution

For this project, you generate a dataset of values according to a specified
distribution.

Specifically, this program generates a textfile *test.output*. Each line
of this text file is a value between 1 and 20 (inclusive bounds). The values
are sampled according to the following table:

| Value | Frequency |
|:-----:|:---------:|
| 20    | x         |
| 19    | x         |
| 18    | x         |
| 17    | x         |
| 16    | x         |
| 15    | x         |
| 14    | x         |
| 13    | x         |
| 12    | x         |
| 11    | x         |
| 10    | x         |
|  9    | x         |
|  8    | x         |
|  7    | x         |
|  6    | x         |
|  5    | x         |
|  4    | x         |
|  3    | x         |
